# RFC-007: IBP Branding and Website

## Summary

This is a follow-up to the original [RFC-007](https://github.com/ibp-network/RFCs/pull/5) for IBP Branding and Website, posted in response to the positive sentiment from members. We received two quotes: [one from Klad](https://github.com/ibp-network/RFCs/pull/5#issuecomment-2376661573), and [the other from LoopLabs](https://github.com/ibp-network/RFCs/pull/5#issuecomment-2396606154). I had calls with both teams, and at this moment it seems more feasible to proceed with with LoopLaps due to their [offer](https://github.com/ibp-network/RFCs/pull/5#issuecomment-2396606154), and their more technical approach and background.

LoopLabs' budget and time estimates, as can be seen in their [offer](https://github.com/ibp-network/RFCs/pull/5#issuecomment-2396606154), is as below:

- Branding - 3850 EUR, 2-3 weeks.
- Web design - 4620 EUR, 2 weeks.
- Web development - 4620 EUR, 2-3 weeks.

The total is 13,090 EUR. Project manager will charge $150 per hour, as is the standard. I will be happy to manage the project, but would also support any other IBP member for the role.


## Notes and Feature Requests

From [@tugytur](https://github.com/tugytur) (original [here](https://github.com/ibp-network/RFCs/pull/5#issuecomment-2366965050)):

- Main visitors will be 'builders', so it should be more focused on that target group.
- Would be nice if we had a tool that lets the visitors test the IBP performance and lets them compare with other providers so that they clearly see the advantages.
- Status page of the global service and individual locations. We can gather the data from the new DNS setup, Prometheus, or both.
- Grafana has a feature that lets to embed dashboards into websites, so we could have global real-time stats on the website.
- Easy way to see the all networks we run and easily get service URLs for those networks
- the wiki should be preferably be generated from markdown files from GitHub, this way we members can constantly update it.

From [@senseless](https://github.com/senseless) (original in the Matrix channel):

- Need to load services, members, etc from GitHub ([config repo](https://github.com/ibp-network/config)).
- Loading utilization (RPC requests, etc) from Prometheus -- Talking with tugy about having him export the data to an accessible json that could be picked up for the website.
- Loading billing, utilization and offline data from ibp-geodns - We will have stats on client requests, member assignments, a billing break down per service, per member, etc. and quorum'd data regarding members uptime and online/offline status.

## Project Commencement Date

The project can commence in the week of the 13th of January, 2025, as confirmed by Rob from LoopLabs in our private conversations.
