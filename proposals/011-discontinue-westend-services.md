# RFC‑010: Discontinue Westend Public Services

## Summary
Paseo is now the official Polkadot testnet, rendering publicly hosted Westend endpoints redundant. Continuing to operate Westend under the Infrastructure Builders Program (IBP) adds unnecessary overhead without providing material benefit.

## Proposal
If approved, the IBP will **terminate all public Westend services—RPC endpoints, GeoDNS records, monitoring, and associated documentation—immediately after this vote passes.** No further payments for Westend services will be made for periods after **June 2025**.

## Voting
Comment on this RFC with **Yes** to approve or **No** to reject. Voting closes **02 July 2025 23:59 UTC**. A simple majority of votes cast determines the outcome.
